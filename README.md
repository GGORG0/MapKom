## About The Project

This is an ~~all-in-one~~ (soon‚Ñ¢) app for ~~all~~ your public transport needs in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. (and maybe more cities later on!)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Features

There is still a lot to do, but once it is all finished, I guarantee you'll love this app!
Stay tuned for updates!

- üëÄ Beautiful **Material Design 3** and Material You look
- üó∫Ô∏è Smooth and snappy **vector map** (no black squares while scrolling around!)
- ü¶Ä Blazingly **fast backend**, written in Rust
- üß© An **extensible and modular** design, allowing for easy addition of new cities
- üõ∞Ô∏è **Real-time location and heading markers** for public transport vehicles, updated every **5 seconds** and streamed to you **instantly**
- üì° **Redundant location sources** to ensure reliability, because Wroc≈Çaw is known for breaking one while leaving the others working
- ~~üß≠ **Routing** between stops, with **transfer support** and **live updates** along your journey~~
- ~~üìà **Live route view** for each vehicle~~
- ~~üïë Vehicle **delay calculation** and stop **arrival time prediction**~~
- ~~üìú **Schedule** viewer~~
- ~~üöè A list of **upcoming arrivals/departures** at a stop~~

## Working Locally

This project is separated into two parts: the backend (Rust) and the frontend (React Native/Expo).

If you use VSCode, you can open the `mapkom.code-workspace` workspace for ease of use.

### Backend

0. [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
1. Clone the repo and go into the `mapkom_server` directory.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GGORG0/MapKom.git
   cd mapkom_server/
   ```
2. Run the project with
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

### Frontend

**Note**: This project **will not** run in Expo Go. You will have to use a development build.

0. Install the prerequisites:
   - Both
     - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
     - [Yarn v4 (Berry)](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) - **Note**: You also need to follow the _Updating Yarn_ section in the linked documentation page to upgrade from Yarn Classic to Yarn Berry
   - iOS
     - [Physical device](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=physical&mode=development-build&buildEnv=local)
     - [Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=simulated&mode=development-build&buildEnv=local)
   - Android
     - [Physical device](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=physical&mode=development-build&buildEnv=local)
     - [Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=simulated&mode=development-build&buildEnv=local)
1. Clone the repo and go into the `mapkom_client` directory.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GGORG0/MapKom.git
   cd mapkom_client/
   ```
2. Install npm dependencies
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Generate the native files
   ```sh
   yarn expo prebuild --clean
   ```
4. Connect your device and run the project

   ```sh
   # For Android
   yarn expo run:android

   # For iOS
   yarn expo run:ios
   ```

5. You can also run the Metro bundler (development server) by itself if you don't want to recompile/reinstall the app
   ```sh
   yarn expo start -d
   ```

## Contributing

Any contributions you make, like a small feature addition, support for a new city or new translations, would be greatly appreciated.

If you have any suggestions you'd like to see implemented, please make a [feature request](https://github.com/GGORG0/MapKom/issues/new?labels=enhancement&template=feature-request.md&title=%5BFR%5D%3A+).

Don't forget to give the project a star if you enjoyed it. Thanks!

### Translating

This project uses [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/).
The translation files are stored in `mapkom_client/lib/i18n/*.json`.

You can use the amazing [i18n-ally](https://github.com/lokalise/i18n-ally/) VSCode extension to help you with translating the project easily. You'll need to open the `mapkom.code-workspace` workspace to get all the correct settings applied.

There will be [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) support coming soon!

### Adding support for a new city

MapKom uses a modular architecture to allow you to more-or-less easily add support for a new city.

Every city has its backend code in the `cities` directory. You can search for `wroclaw` in the entire project to see roughly what you need to implement to add a new city.
